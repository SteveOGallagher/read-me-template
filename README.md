# Assembla ReadMe Template
This ReadMe file is aimed at being a good-practise starting point for projects being build in the Assembla ecosystem. Any part of this can be adjusted in order to tailor more specifically to the project itself, but it is advisable to only add to this rather than to take away details from it.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

## Running the Application

## Development

### Version Control
Provide an applicable description to the commit message pertaining to the issue you have resolved, not the ticket description, and use the syntax ‘re #<ticket number>’ in each commit message to link it to the matching Assembla ticket.. 

For example if the ticket is: 
‘#30 HTML styling incorrect’ 
an example commit message would be: 
‘re #30 - Changed default paragraph style for body elements’

Unacceptable commit messages would be:
‘#30 HTML Styling Incorrect’, ‘#30 Styling issue’, ‘Fixed styling issues’, ‘#30’
